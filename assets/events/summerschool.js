    intro:
      'The increasing growth of urban populations combined with global challenges ranging from digitization to climate change means cities require new innovative ideas and solutions. In this 2019 summer school, four universities will come together to explore the potential of data-driven innovation, with the goals of developing new insights and tools as well as a better understanding of how our cities need to change and adapt in the face of modern challenges. Partner organizations, like Deutsche Bahn, Technologiestiftung Berlin and others, will provide data and current challenges that the cities across the globe are actively grappling with. Over the course of two weeks, interdisciplinary teams will work collaboratively on projects which will then be on display at the public CityLAB exhibition.',

City are facing major changes driven by global challenges, such as climate change, increasing urbanization, automation, and the continued digitization of urban infrastructures. These changes confront us with new economic, social, and technological questions that require thoughtful, complex answers.',

If you have a laptop, please bring it to the summer school, as we don\'t have the infrastructure to provide computers. Included in the summer school are drinks and a small lunch each day. We cannot provide travel or accommodation grants. Every participant will receive a certificate of participation describing the skills you acquired during the summer school. In the past, we have had good experiences with other universities providing course credits for such certificates, but we cannot guarantee this.',
