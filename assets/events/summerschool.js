    'intro': 'The increasing growth of urban populations combined with global challenges ranging from digitization to climate change means cities require new innovative ideas and solutions. In this 2019 summer school, four universities will come together to explore the potential of data-driven innovation, with the goals of developing new insights and tools as well as a better understanding of how our cities need to change and adapt in the face of modern challenges. Partner organizations, like Deutsche Bahn, Technologiestiftung Berlin and others, will provide data and current challenges that the cities across the globe are actively grappling with. Over the course of two weeks, interdisciplinary teams will work collaboratively on projects which will then be on display at the public CityLAB exhibition.',
